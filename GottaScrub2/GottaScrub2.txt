Each project has the following artifacts: 

- 1 Data Model using a UML Class Diagram 
    => Today: Diagrams.net 
        => How to integrate? Has to be an "offline" file, to be part of the resources of the project 
            => A MarkDown file (PlantUML, Mermaid, etc)? 

- 1..n Process Definitions (BPMN) 
    => Today: Cawemo, BPMNs Locally or at GitLab 

- 0..n Decision Definitions (DMN) 
    => Today: DMNs Locally or at GitLab 

- 1..n Forms 
    => Today: Figma 
        => How to integrate? 
            => Miranum JSONForms might be the answer! 

- Written Documentation 
    => Today: written in MarkDown Syntax at GitLab's Wiki, which is separate from the project itself 
        => How to make it more friendly? Gherkin/BDD? 



Uma análise de requisitos pode ser referente a: 
- Greenfield: 
    - Projeto Novo 
- Brownfield: 
    - Corretiva de Projeto 
    - Evolutiva de Projeto 
        - Apenas artefatos novos (raro) 
        - Alteração em artefatos existentes 



Como amarrar o versionamento do artifacts? 
- Data Model, BPMN e DMN são crucias estarem amarrados! 
- Forms podem ter uma certa flexibilidade apenas se não forem utilizados para geração de código, e, portanto, não tiverem relação direta com o Data Model nem com o BPMN;
